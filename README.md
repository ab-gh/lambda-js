# lambda-js

This is a simple js-based visualizer for evaluating lambda calculus expressions. See it in action at [https://yanamal.github.io/lambda-js/](https://yanamal.github.io/lambda-js/).

It is full of janky ugly hacks. Mostly on the visualization side. I do apologize. I initally wrote it immediately after learning about lambda calculus, as am attempt at making sense of it.
