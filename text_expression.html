Functional programming asks: "what if functions could also be used as things/values?"
Lambda calculs asks: "what if all things were functions?"

(part of it is) What if all concepts - True/false, integers, boolean operations - could be described in terms of some behavior they have when given some inputs; 
and these behaviors, combined, produced a sensible/desired output which is consistent with what we expect from true/false, numbers, etc.

In Lambda Calculus, each symbol is both a thing/object and a function??

you recursively expand or apply the very first element , until you are done. (only one element left, OR can't expand/apply for some other reason)

the goal (of defining new 'functions') is to make it so that when it's expanded with the right 'input', it resolves down to some "known" terminal symbol
(in the case of boolean lambda calculus, TRUE or FALSE). They're terminal even though they're not really terminal (they have an expansion) because they are what we care about

You can't always expand everything all the way down, especially without reducing - there's not  always a "bottom"
-->
In lambda calculus, each symbol (TRUE, FALSE, ...) is both a thing and a function, all the time. <br/>
In this implementation, once the evaluation reaches a state with just one symbol (usually, TRUE or FALSE), it stops; in effect, we try to "expand"
a symbol and evaluate it as a funciton, until we just have one left; at that point, we consider it as the "final" return value.

<h2>To evaluate</h2>
Repeatedly click on the expression below.
<h2>To change the expression</h2>
Type in a <b>space separated list of symbols</b> from the list on the right.
<br/>
<b>No other type of input is implemented (yet)</b>.
